A simple nushell script for your reading list.

## Motivation
I have always been reluctant with 2 things:
- properly tracking books I read
- using web for this purpose

As it came to be, for my entire reading journey, I've been using simple txt file.
Once number of lines in said file hit couple of hundred, it started to feel somewhat awkward, and I did what any sane person would do - I kept avoiding this awkwardness.
Not long ago I discovered nushell and decided to try it for once. Before I knew it, this script was born.

Yeah, no grand purpose here, there wasn't even intention to solve the problem to begin with.

## Installation
Didn't figured it out yet.

Hence, it isn't packages yet.

Nothing to see here, yet.

Go away.

## To Do ation
